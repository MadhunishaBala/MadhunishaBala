## Hi there! I'm Madhunisha 😊

I’m an undergraduate studying Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with hands-on experience as a Business Analyst intern.
I enjoy working at the intersection of data, machine learning, and problem-solving, especially where technical solutions meet real business needs.

My work mostly revolves around building predictive models, exploring practical AI use cases, and turning raw data into insights that can support better decisions. I’m equally interested in the why behind a problem as I am in the how of solving it.

## Technologies I work with
- Python, Java, SQL, R
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- TensorFlow, Power BI, Excel

## Current interests
– Machine learning and applied AI
– Data analysis and visualization
– AI-driven business insights
– Improving workflows through better data use
